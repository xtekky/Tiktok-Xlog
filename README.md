#### To generate valid device id's on tiktok, used to bypass ratelimits, there are two processes.
- The first step is called applog, you just send a bunch of device info to tiktok.
- The second step is to validate these device id's. The process is made of a multitude of requests made to the api.
- When doing xlog the bodies are encrypted using a special encryption. There is previews for v01 and v02 (latest) here in the repo
