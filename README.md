xlog 02: 900€ (.py, .php) (encryption/decryption algorithm)
xlog/applog - device registration/validation process = 1500€ (full .py)

#### To generate valid device id's on tiktok, used to bypass ratelimits, there are two processes.
- The first step is called applog, you just send a bunch of device info to tiktok.
- The second step is to validate these device id's. The process is made of a multitude of requests made to the api.
- When doing xlog the bodies are encrypted using a special encryption. You can previews for v01 and v02 (latest) here in the repo
