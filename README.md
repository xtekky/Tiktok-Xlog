To generate valid device id's on tiktok, used to bypass ratelimits, there are two processes.
- The first one is called applog, you just send a bunch of device info to tiktok.
- The second step is to validate these device id's. The process is made of a multitude of requests made to the api.
- When doing xlog the bodies are encrypted using a special encryption. You can see the version 01 here in the repo.
- do not contact me, do you own research
